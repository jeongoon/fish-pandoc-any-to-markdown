* Fish Pandoc Any To Markdown
  A simple fish shell script to convert any documents -- which is supported
  by pandoc -- to markdown format.
  I'm using this with my hakyll blog post when I need to post in another
  system which only supports markdown.

** Requirement

   pandoc command line tool: [[https://pandoc.org/installing.html][Official Install guide]]

** Installation

#+begin_src sh
  curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeongoon/fish-pandoc-any-to-markdown/main/pandoc-any-to-markdown.fish -o pandoc-any-to-markdown.fish
  # move it to where your binary apps are located.
  # normally it is ~/.local/bin on Linux.
  chmod u+x pandoc-any-to-markdown.fish
#+end_src

** Usage

   *Note:* If your file path must contain a extension. ex) /input.org/.

#+begin_src sh
  ./pandoc-any-to-markdown.fish input.org > output.markdown
  #                                       ^^ need to capture both stdout and stderr
#+end_src
